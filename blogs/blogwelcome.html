      <h1>Welcome to Active Women of Tulsa!</h1>
      <strong>Kathy Sluiter</strong><em>-26 April 2022</em>
    <p>Welcome to Active Woman of Tulsa! I am so glad you found us. I sincerely hope you try a new activity or rediscover a love of a familiar one and find new friends in the process.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to explore Oklahoma and all of its surroundings. When I moved back to Tulsa, I realized I had not taken advantage of all that this area has to offer. I took a leap and created this group as a place where women can feel comfortable with others in a judgment-free zone, supporting each other no matter where we are in life, and regardless of our height, weight, age, or ethnicity. </p>
    <p>We are always open to new ideas. Is there something you have always wanted to try? Let me know! I’m willing to bet others want to try it too and it may just be added to our calendar of events. </p>
    <p>We can always use more event hosts! Let me know if there’s an event you’d like to host.</p>
