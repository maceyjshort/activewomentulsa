      <h1>What is your number?</h1>
      <strong>Kathy Sluiter</strong><em>-XX April 2022</em>
    <p>Women value who they are and how they should feel by a number. Sounds pretty silly but ask one of your friends, how many steps did you take today?  Their action will be based on if they made their, steps or not.  How many times have you heard or heard a friend say, I will feel good about myself if I can lose 10 pounds or I will feel good about myself if I can get back down in my skinny jeans. The list goes on and on, I know I’ve said it. </p>
    <p>I believe we need to eat healthily and exercise, don’t get me wrong.  But why can’t we feel good at any size?  Shouldn’t we look at ourselves by what we have accomplished? With all that you endured in life, you didn’t give up on yourself. Should that be proud we walked through hell and yet come out stronger and wiser?
    </p>
    <p>We are always open to new ideas. Is there something you have always wanted to try? Let me know! I’m willing to bet others want to try it too and it may just be added to our calendar of events. </p>
    <p>Be Proud no matter what that scale says, hold your head up high, and Celebrate Yourself! You are AMAZING the way you are! </p>
