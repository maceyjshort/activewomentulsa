      <h1>Mental Health: AFT to Brainspotting</h1>
      <strong>Kathy Sluiter</strong><em>-XX April 2022</em>
    <p>After I left my second ex-husband in 2000, I was broken. I had two failed marriages in a matter of 4 years.  On the surface, I had the fairy tale marriage, he was good-looking, he made great money, he was great to my children.  At night our house was either happy or hell, no in-between. I had finally come to terms with the fact this was not a good environment for my children.  My cousin came to help me pack up the U-Haul in Bella Vista, Arkansas to move to Cleveland Oklahoma.</p>
    <p>I cried myself to sleep every night, I didn’t want to get out of bed, I didn’t shower for days on end.  I had 4 children to care for so I pulled myself together, I was hired by my favorite radio station selling advertising.  One of my co-workers encouraged me to get counseling, the company paid for the first 5 sessions. I was so worried that my ex would use that as ammunition in court to get my children from me.  I was also worried that the psychologist would diagnose me with a mental illness.  Neither of those things happened. Instead, she made me feel proud of surviving my childhood trauma without any addictions.  Since then, I have been on a self-help, self-aware journey. </p>
    <p>In the past 5 years, I have personally used Aroma Freedom Techniques (AFT), I have used Brainspotting by our wonderful Yvonne and then I did hypnotherapy.  Here’s a breakdown of what each of them are.</p>
    <p>AFT: The Aroma Freedom Technique is a step by step process designed to be learned and used by anyone who wants more freedom in their life.  It is an entirely new approach to aromatherapy, one that uses pre essentials oils to instantly and irresistibly shirt a person’s mental state, mood and ability to take positive actions. Through their process you will learn how to identify what you want in life, what is blocking you and how to release blocks in a matter of minutes. </p>
    <p>Brianspotting locates points in the client’s visual field that help to access unprocessed trauma in the subcortical brain.  Brianspotting was discovered in 2003 by David Grand, PhD. Over 13.000 (and counting) have been trained in BSP. Dr. Grand discovered that “Where you look affects how you feel”. It is the brain activity, especially in the subcortical brain that organizes itself around the eye position. <a href="https://brainspotting.com/directory/name/yvonne-lewis-lpc/">Yvonne</a> is only accepting new Brianspotting via referrals, you must tell her I referred you.</p>
    <p>Hypnotherapy is a state of inner absorption, concentration and focused attention of the subconscious that heightens a subject’s receptivity to suggestion, much like focusing the sun’s rays through a magnifying glass.  Hypnotherapy is safe and accepted by progressive medicine and science today as helpful for many conditions. Contrary to movies and folklore, hypnotherapy is not mind control or brainwashing.  Above all a hypnotherapist cannot make a person do anything he or she doesn’t want to do. One memory and facilities are fully aware during hypnosis.  The blocks you feel in life are a direct result from a childhood trauma. It gets to the root cause and realizes the negative hold it has on you. James is accepting new patients, here is the <a href="https://browninghypnotherapy.com/">link</a> to his practice. </p>
