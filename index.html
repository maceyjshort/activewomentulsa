      <h1>Welcome to Active Women of Tulsa!</h1>
      <p>While living in Florida, I was lacking friends to do fun events with. The Meetup groups in the area really were lacking opportunities for women. When you attend singles groups, there is the underlying pressure of we are here to date or worse yet there is always that one creepy man who tries to date, everyone. I started my own group but then decided to move back to Oklahoma.</p>
      <h2>Why we do it</h2>
      <p>When I arrived here, I was surprised to see a Women's only group called Bold Betties, That is where I met Camile who was looking for women to host events in the local chapter. When that group closed nationally, I decided to create this group which I feel, filled in the gap of what was missing in Tulsa. </p>
      <p>I felt like needed a group that supported all women, not just the bold ones but the ones who just wanted to go out to eat and have girlfriend time. What you can expect to find is weekend trips, hiking, shooting guns, and eating out from brunch to dinner.
      Most importantly, I wanted to create a space where women are not judged, a place to feel comfortable to be themselves without judgment. </p>
